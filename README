dsync - Distributed Directory Synchronization Utility

dsync is intended to be an rsync-like utility that takes advantage of the
decentralization and fault- and absentee-tolerant nature of bittorrent and git.

This runs basically on the same principle as rsync, but on a peer-to-peer
basis, rather than rsync's client-server model. Furthermore, rather than
assuming any particular node to have the correct copy, precedence is given to
the newest.

Using bittorrent as both transfer protocol and metadata generator, and git as a
metadata manager, a dsync'd directory structure is decentralized and tolerant
of slow or temporarily absent nodes.
