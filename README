dsync - Distributed Directory Synchronization Utility

dsync is intended to be an rsync-like utility that takes advantage of the
decentralization and fault- and absentee-tolerant nature of bittorrent and git.

This runs basically on the same principle as rsync, but on a peer-to-peer
basis, rather than rsync's client-server model. Furthermore, rather than
assuming any particular node to have the correct copy, precedence is given to
the newest.

Bittorrent will act as the metadata generator, where the metadata are the
.torrent files, as well as the transfer protocol, providing for minimal,
distributed transfers. The metadata will be version-controlled by git, so no
node becomes a single point of failure, and multiple changes of the same file
are detected.

This is particularly ideal for maintaining large collections of large files,
for which it would be expensive to maintain revisions. In order to allow for
proper version control, some nodes might maintain revisions to which all other
nodes could repair.
