Programs:

dsync
	Synchronize mirrored hosts

dinit - dsync init
	Create a .dsync meta-directory for current directory

ddd - dsync delta daemon
	Verify each file in meta-directory at regular intervals


Further notes:

We need a way to keep track of nodes, for verification of valid peers. This
requires some sort of web of trust. (GPG PubKey, IP) tuple signed by existing
peer? Then, perhaps git pushes/pulls can run along these same lines, and
bittorrent clients only connect to trusted peers (for seed OR leech).

.torrent files must be multi-tracker, with every node mirroring that file a
tracker

We don't want to be constantly seeding files that are fully synced, so we need
a way of automatically requesting reseeds and responding to said requests.
